              "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
              I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredingly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
              Since completing the course. I've successfully switched carrers, working as a Software Engineer  at VR startup."

          "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programing step by step.
          I was encourage to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
          They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
          In fact, I have often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend! "
